          <h1 className="font-medium py-3 ">Electric vs Gas Heaters</h1>
          <p className="text-[13px]">
            When it comes to heaters, there are two types available. The first
            one is the electric heater that uses electricity to run and the
            other one is a gas heater that uses a specific amount of gas to run
            itself. The Electric heater is known to offer high energy efficiency
            as it easily heats up a room in a short matter of time. It can be
            used in closed spaces as it is not harmful to health. Due to its
            small sizes, it is the best option to use if you want to have a
            portable heating option. It requires a continuous electrical outlet
            so should be placed near a power unit. Some of them use electricity
            as equivalent to an air conditioner. A Gas heater is less expensive
            as compared to an electric heater. It also offers great portability
            as the gas pipe can be attached as long as you want. It has the
            ability to function if power outages occur and you will have
            continuous heat. Another benefit is that gives heat very quickly.
            One thing to keep in mind here is that no home d√©cor should be
            placed near it or it might catch fire.
